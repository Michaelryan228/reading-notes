# How Javascript Makes Web Pages More Interactive

## Acess COntent

* Use javascript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page
* Select the text inside all of the <h1> elements on a page
* Select any elements that have a class attribute with a value of note
* Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has a value of email

## Modify Content

* You can use Javascript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them.  For example:
* Add a paragraph of text after the first <h1> element
* Change the value of class attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements
* Change the size or position of an <img> element

## Program Rules

* You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example:
* A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image.
* A mortgage calculator could collect values from a form, perform a calculation, and display repayments
* An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area (also known as the viewport)
