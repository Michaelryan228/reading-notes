# How HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT Fit Together

* Web devs usually talk about these 3 languages
* Aim to keep the three languages in seperate files
* Each language forms a layer with a different purpose
* Each layer builds on the previous layer
* html, css, javascript, in that order
## html

* Content layer
* .html files
* Content of page lives here
* html gives page structure and adds semantics

## css

* Presentation layer
* .css files
* The CSS enhances the html page with rules that state how html content is presented

## javascript

* .js files
* Change how page behaves
* Adds interactivity
* Aim to keep as much of javascript as possible in seperate files
