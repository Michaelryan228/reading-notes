* You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be.
* Result being Boolean: true or false

## ==

### Is equal to

* This operator compares two values (number, strings, or Booleans) to see if they are the same
* 'Hello' == 'Goodbye' returns false because they are not the same string.

## ===

### Strict Equal to

* '3' === '3' returns true because they are the same data type and value

## !=

### Is Not Equal To

* This operator compares two values (numbers, strings, or Booleans) to see if they are not the same.

## !==
