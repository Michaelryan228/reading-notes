Django ships with a built-in User model for authentication and if you'd like a basic tutorial on how to implement log in, log out, sign up and so on see the Django Login and Logout tutorial for more.

However, for a real-world project, the official Django documentation highly recommends using a custom user model instead. This provides far more flexibility down the line so, as a general rule, always use a custom user model for all new Django projects.

But how to implement one? The official documentation example is not actually what many Django experts recommend using. There is a far easier yet still powerful approach to starting off new Django projects with a custom user model which I'll demonstrate here.

Setup
To start, create a new Django project from the command line. We need to do several things:

create and navigate into a dedicated directory called accounts for our code
install Django
make a new Django project called config
make a new app accounts
start the local web server
Here are the commands to run:

$ cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir accounts && cd accounts
$ pipenv install django~=3.1.0
$ pipenv shell
(accounts) $ django-admin.py startproject config .
(accounts) $ python manage.py startapp accounts
(accounts) $ python manage.py runserver
Note that we did not run migrate to configure our database. It's important to wait until after we've created our new custom user model before doing so.
