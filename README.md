## Growth Mindset
I believe growth mindset is a state of mind that allows for adaptibility.  You need to be able to take things in stride and change accordingly to any obstacle that may present itself.  Naturally, being positive throughout will help.  You should be sure to embrace challanges when they present themselves as they will hone your skills.  When you reach an obstacle you should persist and when more effort is required you may need to sacrfice some things in order to achieve your goal.  Accept critism when it is offered as this too will help you advance and you should seek inspiration in the success of those who have come before.  

## Remember
* **Embrace Challanges**
* **Persist in the face of setbacks**
* **See efforts as the path to mastery**
* **Learn from critcism**
* **Find lessons and insiration in the success of others**
* **All of this will give you a greater sense of free will**

#### Rabindranth Tagore
Was a poet who once said
>The one who plants trees, knowing that he will never sit in their shade, has atleast started to understand the meaning of life.
So dont forget things take time and if youre lucky the things you do in life might help someone else in the *future.*
