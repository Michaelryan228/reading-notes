##Growth Mindset
I believe growth mindset is a state of mind that allows for adaptibility.  You need to be able to take things in stride and change accordingly to any obstacle that may present itself.  Naturally, being positive throughout will help.  You should be sure to embrace challanges when they present themselves as they will hone your skills.  When you reach an obstacle you should persist and when more effort is required you may need to sacrfice some things in order to achieve your goal.  Accept critism when it is offered as this too will help you advance and you should seek inspiration in the success of those who have come before.
