## Layers of a Web Page

### html

#### Content Layer

* html files
* This is where the content of the page lives.  The html gives the page structure and adds semantics

### css

#### Presentation Layer

* css files
* The css enhances the html page with rules that state how the html content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.)

### javascript

#### Behavior Layer

* js files
* This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity.  We will aim to keep as much of our javascript as possible in seperate files.
