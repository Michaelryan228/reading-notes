Managing Django Settings: Issues
Different environments. Usually, you have several environments: local, dev, ci, qa, staging, production, etc. Each environment can have its own specific settings (for example: DEBUG = True, more verbose logging, additional apps, some mocked data, etc). You need an approach that allows you to keep all these Django setting configurations.

Sensitive data. You have SECRET_KEY in each Django project. On top of this there can be DB passwords and tokens for third-party APIs like Amazon or Twitter. This data cannot be stored in VCS.

Sharing settings between team members. You need a general approach to eliminate human error when working with the settings. For example, a developer may add a third-party app or some API integration and fail to add specific settings. On large (or even mid-size) projects, this can cause real issues.

Django settings are a Python code. This is a curse and a blessing at the same time. It gives you a lot of flexibility, but can also be a problem – instead of key-value pairs, settings.py can have a very tricky logic.

Setting Configuration: Different Approaches
There is no built-in universal way to configure Django settings without hardcoding them. But books, open-source and work projects provide a lot of recommendations and approaches on how to do it best. Let’s take a brief look at the most popular ones to examine their weaknesses and strengths.

settings_local.py
This is the oldest method. I used it when I was configuring a Django project on a production server for the first time. I saw a lot of people use it back in the day, and I still see it now.

The basic idea of this method is to extend all environment-specific settings in the settings_local.py file, which is ignored by VCS. Here’s an example:

settings.py file:

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['example.com']
DEBUG = False
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'production_db',
        'USER': 'user',
        'PASSWORD': 'password',
        'HOST': 'db.example.com',
        'PORT': '5432',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'sslmode': 'require'
        }
    }
}

...

settings_local.py file:

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost']
DEBUG = True
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'local_db',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}

Pros:
Secrets not in VCS.
Cons:
settings_local.py is not in VCS, so you can lose some of your Django environment settings.
The Django settings file is a Python code, so settings_local.py can have some non-obvious logic.
You need to have settings_local.example (in VCS) to share the default configurations for developers.
Separate settings file for each environment
This is an extension of the previous approach. It allows you to keep all configurations in VCS and to share default settings between developers.

In this case, you make a settings package with the following file structure:

settings/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── base.py
   ├── ci.py
   ├── local.py
   ├── staging.py
   ├── production.py
   └── qa.py
settings/local.py:

from .base import *


ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost']
DEBUG = True
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'local_db',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}

To run a project with a specific configuration, you need to set an additional parameter:

python manage.py runserver --settings=settings.local

Pros:
All environments are in VCS.
It’s easy to share settings between developers.
Cons:
You need to find a way to handle secret passwords and tokens.
“Inheritance” of settings can be hard to trace and maintain.
Environment variables
To solve the issue with sensitive data, you can use environment variables.
import os


SECRET_KEY = os.environ['SECRET_KEY']
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': os.environ['DATABASE_NAME'],
        'HOST': os.environ['DATABASE_HOST'],
        'PORT': int(os.environ['DATABASE_PORT']),
    }
}
view rawenv_approach_settings.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub
This is the simplest example using Python os.environ and it has several issues:

You need to handle KeyError exceptions.
You need to convert types manually (see DATABASE_PORT usage).
To fix KeyError, you can write your own custom wrapper. For example:

import os

from django.core.exceptions import ImproperlyConfigured


def get_env_value(env_variable):
    try:
      	return os.environ[env_variable]
    except KeyError:
        error_msg = 'Set the {} environment variable'.format(var_name)
        raise ImproperlyConfigured(error_msg)


SECRET_KEY = get_env_value('SECRET_KEY')
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': get_env_value('DATABASE_NAME'),
        'HOST': get_env_value('DATABASE_HOST'),
        'PORT': int(get_env_value('DATABASE_PORT')),
    }
}
view rawenv_approach_advanced.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub
Also, you can set default values for this wrapper and add type conversion. But actually there is no need to write this wrapper, because you can use a third-party library (we’ll talk about this later).

Pros:
Configuration is separated from code.
Environment parity – you have the same code for all environments.
No inheritance in settings, and cleaner and more consistent code.
There is a theoretical grounding for using environment variables – 12 Factors.
Cons:
You need to handle sharing default config between developers.
12 Factors
12 Factors is a collection of recommendations on how to build distributed web-apps that will be easy to deploy and scale in the Cloud. It was created by Heroku, a well-known Cloud hosting provider.

As the name suggests, the collection consists of twelve parts:

Codebase
Dependencies
Config
Backing services
Build, release, run
Processes
Port binding
Concurrency
Disposability
Dev/prod parity
Logs
Admin processes
Each point describes a recommended way to implement a specific aspect of the project. Some of these points are covered by instruments like Django, Python, pip. Some are covered by design patterns or the infrastructure setup. In the context of this article, we are interested in one part: the Configuration.

Its main rule is to store configuration in the environment. Following this recommendation will give us strict separation of config from code.
